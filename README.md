**Title of the project**: Transfer Learning Based Kidney Stone Detection Using ResNet50
The "Transfer Learning Based Kidney Stone Detection Using ResNet50" project demonstrates the potential of using advanced deep learning techniques for automating the detection of kidney stones.
By utilizing transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture, we are trying to find an efficient and accurate solution to a critical medical problem.
ResNet is a high-performing deep CNN known for its effectiveness in image recognition. 
It is capable of learning specialized feature extractors for urinary tract stones through the finetuning of its model. 
Transfer learning  is a technique that utilizes the weights of pretrained models as initial values, fine tunes them to suit a specific dataset, and applies them to new tasks. 
Through this process, it is anticipated that a deep learning model with high accuracy in determining the presence or absence of urinary tract stones will be developed.
For Reference i have referred previous year  papers as follows:
Soni et al. 2020[1] proposed  automated kidney Stone Classifiaction using machine learning.
Histogram Equalization is advantageous for improving image contrast thereby enhanching data quality.
Viswanath et al. 2015[2] proposed a level set segmentation-based kidney stone detection and classification method.
